# Recommending books from their plots
This project uses plots from books and make a recommendation of similar books. The dataset is available here: https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/ucsdbookgraph/home
I wrote a function that will take the ISBN of a book give you a list of ISBN's of 10 similar books using TF-IDF algorithm and cosine similarity.
